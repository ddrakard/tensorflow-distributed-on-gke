This project is designed to make it easier to get up to get started running
large scale ML training jobs. It intends to avoid the time-consuming problems
that can be encountered while working with these new technologies. Therefore,
if you encounter any difficulties while using this project, please let us know!
We can resolve the problem and add it to the project. Any suggestions for
clarification improvements are welcome for the same reason.
